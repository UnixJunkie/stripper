INTRODUCTION AND REQUIREMENTS

The following tools are required to compile STRIPPER:

	- The latest version of the OpenBabel source code (at least version 2.3)
	- A C++ compiler (like g++) 
	- A makefile system (like GNU make) 
	- CMake system (www.cmake.org)

If you want to install globally on your system, you will need root access, and should follow these instructions.


INSTALL GLOBALLY (YOU NEED ROOT ACCESS)

(1) Open a command window, and decompress the downloaded file with following command:

> tar -xvf stripper-1.0.4.tar.gz

This will extract all the files into the 'stripper-1.0.4' directory. 

(2) You now need to configure and compile STRIPPER. Run the following commands, one after the other:

> cd stripper-1.0.4
> cmake CMakeLists.txt
> make

(3) If you have root permissions, you can install openbabel globally. As root, run the following command:

> make install
> make clean 
> make test

(4) Now you can try to run STRIPPER:

> stripper -v

In case you get an error message like "libopenbabel.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory", this means that STRIPPER does not know the location of the OpenBabel libraries. Try putting
this in your e.g. ~/.bashrc file

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/

Then restart a shell, and run STRIPPER again.
